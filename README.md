# bike_data_DC


In this repository the Data of the bicycles in Washington DC is used. Starting from a CSV file, the data is initially converted into a Dataframe. Afterwards we have to analyze and answer different questionnaires developed by me to generate different plots.

Different pivot tables are created and through an analysis it is possible to understand in which part of the day it is more profitable to have more bicycles available. In the same way it is possible to understand which sectors of the city are the most trafficked and therefore in which sector it is more or less profitable to have bicycles available.

In addition, different correlation plots are performed to see up to what point there is a correlation between the different values. Mathematical linear regression is used to solve the different unknowns.
